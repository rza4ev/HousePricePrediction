Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other relevant attributes. The data is sourced from Bina.az, a popular real estate website. The project involves the following steps:

Web scraping to collect data from Bina.az
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Data visualization to gain insights
Building machine learning models for price prediction
Deploying the model using Streamlit for easy access and interaction


The data collection process involves web scraping from Bina.az using Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and requests. The collected data includes various features relevant to house prices.

Data Visualization
Data visualization is performed to understand the distribution and relationships between different features. Various plots and charts are created using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Visualization Examples
Distribution of house prices
Correlation matrix
Scatter plots for price vs. features
The visualization scripts and notebooks can be found in the visualization folder.

Modeling
Machine learning models are built to predict house prices. Different models are trained and evaluated to find the best-performing model. The models include:
Linear Regression
Random Forest


Deployment
The final model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the model and make predictions.


Usage
Web Scraping: Collect data by running the web scraping script.
Data Visualization: Generate visualizations to understand the data.
Model Training: Train the machine learning models.
Deployment: Run the Streamlit app to deploy the model.
